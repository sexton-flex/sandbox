# SOAP Web Services

## What is this for?

This soap sub-repo is to play around and learn SOAP with different implementations.

## Resources

[SOAP Web Services Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) is a great YouTube playlist to get started with SOAP Web Services. It will explain:

- Overview of what SOAP web services are.
- Common SOAP jargon.
- How to interact with SOAP.
- Writing a web service and implementation in Java.

Not all 20 videos are required, but I highly recommend the first 5.

## What is this repo focused on?

1. Sending a request and receiving a response in a NodeJS environment.
2. Creating a SOAP client.
3. Add PFX Certificate to the client options.
4. Describing the WSDL ontract using the `soap` package.
5. Logging the request and response as JSON.
